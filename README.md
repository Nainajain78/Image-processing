# 🎨 Image Compression using K-Means Clustering (ML Model)

This project **compresses images** using **Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)**.  
The model learns color patterns and applies clustering to reduce the number of unique colors.

## 🚀 Features
- Trains a **K-Means model** on an image dataset
- Uses **unsupervised ML** to compress images
- Saves and loads a **trained K-Means model**
- Generates a **compressed version** of the image
